# Mini-projet - Netflix-n-chill

This repository is a school project made to teach us about databases.

## Presentation

> Netflix provides services to its European customers, it is subject to the GDPR, and as such, it must provide a means of consulting the data it has on its customers.

So to discover in more detail one of the four database management systems seen in class, we sent request to the Netflix history of a typical user.

The data of the history is classified in a CSV file of 10,856 lines. This represents **10 years** of use!

This project is carried out using a randomly selected DBMS. Mine being: ElasticSearch.

## How does it work ?

All the data should already be on the ElasticSearch server. You just need to connect yourself to kibana and copy/paste the requests in the editor then run them :)
